Artificial intelligence skin cancer detectors are popular alternatives to dermatology. However, current tools underrepresent darker skin and perform significantly worse on dark skin. MelaninMed is an AI skin classifier and mobile application built with diversity as a priority. MelaninMed has three parts: a malignancy classifier, a lesion diagnosis system, and an intuitive SwiftUI mobile application. MelaninMed leverages ResNet18 and a ViT adaptor to achieve 99% accuracy across 78 skin conditions, with no significant performance difference between skin tones.

To run: train both models on the Stanford Diverse Dermatology Images Dataset. Export through CoreML, and upload into an XCode project. Use the other files provided to create the structure of the app, and import the models.
